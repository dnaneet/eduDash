I will not discuss this exam with peers, friends, family, neighbors until the week after the exam. Discussing any aspect of this exam with others until the week after the exam OR answering this question with ""false"" calls into question your academic integrity and will lead to a total invalidation of your exam score.

",0,"43429009: Design Problem
[Partial credit is available for this problem. Please show your calculations in organized fashion. You may use upto 2 lettersize pages for your work for this problem.]
The beam shown in the figure is made from two boards. Evaluate the maximum shear stress in the glue necessary to hold the boards together along the seam where they are joined. Report the absolute value of your answer, in MPa.

For convenience, the following information is provided:

The Centroidal location,  is 0.120 m from the bottom.
The Moment of Inertia of the cross-section, about its neutral axis (""NA"") is .
The Young's modulus of the material for the two boards is 13 GPa.
The vertical reactions at the supports are 6.5 kN and 19.5 kN.
